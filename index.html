			I am a third-year fellow at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation in Seattle where I model the inequalities in educational attainment across the world and how these inequalities affect poorer health outcomes, while working towards an MPH in Health Metrics Sciences. My interests in big data, sociology, and science began with the Natural History of Song project at Harvard in which we described human universals in music making and musical perception. After a pivot to the health sciences and sociology, I have used my expieriences with behavioral lab work and very messy crowdsourced data to inform analyses of large-scale household surveys and linked registry data. Working in social epidemiology for over two years now, I have seen my research interests move increasingly away from individualistic relationships between human capital and poorer health outcomes towards community- and nation-oriented dynamics of the distributions of human capital across populations. <br><br>

			I increasingly believe social epidemiology is ultimately a tool for examining the downstream consequences of our social and political institutions, which has steered my own research towards current trends in the sociology and demography literatures. Within these fields, I am most interested in the intergenerational inheritance of socio-economic position, prospects for social mobility given inhereted social capital, rigorous methods for measuring inequality, and using social justice to inform my research. Additionally, I am interested in innovative methods involving machine learning, nonparametric and semiparametric modeling, and big data; and I am interested in sociological theory rooted in evolutionary psychology, informed by moral philosphy, and specific to unique geographies and political systems.
